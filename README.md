# libraries used:

2- scikit learn
3- matplotlib , SNS

# data sets used in analysis
boston : calendar , listings
Seattle : calendar
style  : data frame names(name_df)

# questions the analysis aims to answer:
1- 1- What is the prices range for an accommodation in Boston
2- does the number of beds,bathrooms or bedrooms make the price increase ?
does bringing multiple people with you affect the price ?
3- what are the dates boston is frequently visited in?
4- Is there a certain month where there is little so little visits that prices might drop ?

#conclusion:
- Most listings in Boston have good ratings, if you are looking just to go with the flow you would probably want to visit Boston in September,if your looking for high availability going in January might be a good idea, the prices seem to be correlated with the number of accomodates,bedrooms and bathrooms and surly the number of accommodates increases for each bed.
