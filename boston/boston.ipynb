I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience. \\r\\nIn addition, the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle, and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.\\r\\nAgain, I never want to post a negative comment, but this was just too much for me.

On Saturday night there was a huge party up and down the block due to a parade the next day.  The lack of insulation had the two sick, cold girls left with no sleep.  For the next night, the neighbors upstairs had a fight so bad that we almost called the police.  Terrible.  So no sleep that night.

This raises serious hygiene concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it get’s worse: next day there was an electricity outage in my room, and the only way to get any light was to get an extension cord from one of the rooms to mine, so that I could have one lamp.

So I went ahead and adjusted- and no reply. I asked them again in person AGAIN, and they said \"We have to talk it over and adjust it, no problem\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I waited, until its already 9/3. Its been OVER 10+ days and they have been COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I contacted airbnb and basically FORCED the hosts to reply in which they rejected my request. \\r\\n\\r\\n?? excuse me, if you were going to reject it why tell me you would refund my nights?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow its almost 1 MONTH after and they are still not responsive. I have called airbnb and filed an official complaint against them- including opening a case for them to return my money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether my money is returned or not, I just want to warn everyone that:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.) not a healthy, or clean environment to stay in\\r\\n2.) don't stay here if you don't want to deal with irresponsible, frustrating people\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</td>\n",

We would have washed them with the available washer and dryer on the floor, and also would have taken care of some of our wet clothes from the horrible rain, but we had used the dryer once to fluff up some of our clothes that were wrinkly from packing and there wasn't enough credit to do a full wash and dry.

I was going to be the contact person since I booked it through my account. All seemed fine. The first (although small) hickup was the confirmation on how to obtain the keys was only sent the morning of my colleague's arrival (I had asked the day before after not hearing about it from Jason at all). My colleague was already on the plane but luckily he was able to check emails upon arrival to find out how to access the place. Phew. His assessment of the apt afterwards was: \"The place was mostly clean (except for blankets on the couch that smelled like pets), but it wasn’t a “homely” place that I would immediately recommend: the bedroom was a single air mattress on the ground of an otherwise empty room. It had wifi, an mini ironing board, and heating, so I guess that’s everything I needed. Knowing that the TV didn’t work ahead of time might have been helpful to other visitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFine. He had all the basics and we were not further going to worry about the non-homyness or anything else. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince no instructions on what to do with the keys were sent until 6:45am of the day of departure it was too late to inform my colleague who had left early. A few days later I get a message from Jason, \"He's going to get a horrible review\", without further explanation. Since the booking was through my account I enquired with him and learned that Jason thought my colleague had not locked the door! \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon immediate consultation with my colleague I learned that he \\r\\nhad left the keys on the kitchen table. He had to make a good faith decision to leave the keys in the house with the door snapped shut preventing access without a key. It was the better option than to hand off the keys uninstructed (at that time of departure) in any other way (apparently preferred). (More detail: My colleague had locked one of the two locks from the inside to make sure your place would be locked. Of course he was not able lock the second deadbolt lock because he left the keys inside.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim that the door was not locked at all and not even enquiring with me but instead immediately threatening a \"horrible review\" made me very uncomfortable. The whole thing could have easily been avoided in the first place if Jason would have sent timely instructions. I had to ask for every detail before getting an answer. Compared to previous airbnb bookings this was not very forthcoming but perhaps I have been spoiled by other hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, to be fair, Jason responded with \"Ok no worries\" after I explained the door situation.

We were able to get the keys when we arrived. \\r\\nWhile it was nice to be so close to the nightlife of Boston, it was a little too close. We arrived on a Saturday night and were within walking distance of an awesome bowling alley/bar. However, this bar is literally right outside of the window of the apartment and people were out being very loud until about 3am, so we didn't get much sleep.\\r\\n Because of this, I would recommend the apartment to people interested in experiencing Boston nightlife. It's not for people looking for a good night's sleep. \\r\\nThe building is pretty run down. The elevator is a bit scary- like one that you've only seen in black and white movies. It reminded me a bit of the Tower of Terror at Disney World. \\r\\nThe walls of the building are paper thin so you can easily hear people in the other apartments. \\r\\nThe apartment is on the grungy side. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. There is no top sheet on the futon bed. There is no television but there is internet. \\r\\nWe weren't told what time to leave the next day so we were planning on noon. A little before noon, the door unlocked and 3 people walked in. They were the next renters and were told it was okay to come. It would have been nice if Sean let me know as the bed was not made and we had a few dishes to do. I felt bad having the next people come in without having the place cleaned a bit first. \\r\\nOverall, it was not a horrible experience. It was fun being in that area despite not getting much sleep.

This checklist should include: *Change out all linens and replace with clean, fresh, linens (including mattress pads). All pillows and down/faux down comforters should have fresh/clean covers. Replace towels with clean/fresh towels that are in good condition and free of rips/tears/frays. *Wash all dirty dishes, dry them, and place them away neatly in the cabinets. Wipe down all surfaces with an antibacterial cleaner. *Check for trash and remove all trash from apartment (includes looking inside the bathroom medicine cabinet and refrigerator). *Dust all surfaces (including window sills, table, cubby/shelves. *Scrub shower and toilet (Mr. Clean bathroom magic eraser works well for the tub). Also wipe down walls and sink with a bathroom cleaner (and ceiling if necessary). *vacuum all floors and follow with mop or Swiffer mop. *shampoo area rug every month. Vacuum after every tenant. *check bed frame for needed repairs. Repair (professionally) as needed, before renting to a new tenant. Check mattresses for stains/wear &amp; tear and replace as needed. *Check all areas of apartment for needed repairs and repair as necessary. Upon arrival, it was easy to find and open the lockbox. Apparently the address is no longer on Irving St. The key wouldn't work, so I had to call Sean. He said the new address should have been emailed to me, but it wasn't. The new apartment is just around the corner though and easy to find. The entry from the street was easy to find and enter. After going up to flights of stairs (no elevator, beware if you have a lot of luggage), we made it to our door (#6). Entry was no problem, but locking it from the inside and outside was hard and took a lot of effort to get the door just right so it would lock. Sean thought we were arriving later than we did, so he said he was on the way to change/do the laundry. When we walked in, the previous tenants bedding was on the bed, and trash was under the sink area. We were hungry anyway so we dropped our luggage and went to find dinner. When we arrived at the apartment a couple hours later, fresh bedding was on the queen bed, but the twin bed underneath was only covered by a mattress pad. Upon sitting on the queen bed, it made a horrible creaking noise every time we moved even an inch. Upon further inspection, we found a paint can supporting the bed frame as well as broken slats underneath the mattress. It also sounds like there is a hard plastic cover on the mattress. I looked for a sheet to cover the twin mattress, but the only thing I found was an uncovered faux down blanket. I text Sean to ask about the sheet, and after 15 minutes of no response, I called him.

A $225/night price for small unit such as this implies a level of quality and cleanliness that was simply not met.

From the outside, it is the worst looking building on the block. This, it turns out, is also indicative of the inside. The interior common areas are also run down. For example: there is plaster decay depositing debris from ceiling in the hallway leading to your door. Once inside, the apartment is hardly well lit, as the title of the ad says and the over-exposed photos in the posting imply. The carpeting by the bed was filthy. To claim the unit works for up to three people is questionable, in our opinion. The bed is suitable for one adult only...which is why my husband slept on the floor with an inflatable backpacking sleeping pad. The couch is not suitable for sleeping on....even our 13 year old daughter who is not picky about sleeping arrangements had a horrible night's sleep. On the floor near where you have mirrors propped against the wall are exposed staples in the floor...I assume left over from carpet that was once there. With a black tile, black refrigerator, black counter top, black stove, dark flooring, and a very dim overhead light, the kitchen was difficult to see and work in. The refrigerator was dented and scratched up. There is a large amount of dust and build up next to and under the refrigerator and stove. The toaster oven sits right on the range...I would never think of turning on one of the heating elements for fear of starting a fire (is this how the knob on the toaster oven got burned?). Many of the floor tiles in the kitchen are peeling up. The A/C unit looks like it has been duct taped into the window. There is a lot of clutter in the unit…to the point we were afraid of leave something behind. With all this, we had to wonder how clean the towels, sheets and dishes were.

The first thing we reconized was the smell in the whole building. It was like a mixture of cat litter and old stuff, which was just spicy in your nose. When we came into the appartment the smell was there too, not that intensive but annoying. So we checked the rooms and had to search for the fifth possibilty to sleep at. An adult person would never fit into the couch, which you can see on the picture but Curtis wrote me that someone can sleep there aswell. \\r\\nAlso there was just 1 towel in the bathroom for 5 person. And we had to sleep with two people (with one sheet and not a blanket) on one of the singlebeds, which was horrible, because they aren´t comfortable even with just one person on it. \\r\\nFor breakfast we had first to clean the plates and cups, because we did not to eat the old crumbs of strangers. \\r\\nSo I have asked Curtis for what we have paid a daily rate for FIVE person when nothing is prepared for FIVE person.

       "1089   Pros: The location and the apartment setup were extremely convenient - if you're looking for a pretty cheap place to stay the night that's super easy to get to from the airport, I would definitely recommend this place. Wi-fi was good. The towels and sheets were nice and clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: The building (particularly the shared bathroom) was pretty dirty. I think it gets cleaned once a week, although some of the grime in the bathroom seemed older than a week. The fridge in my room was stained and smelled horrible when I opened it - luckily I didn't have to store any food during my stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2450   First of all, Anthony and his family was nice and friendly and tried to make our stay most comfortable as possible under the rooming conditions. However, the room was incredible cold, the windows were covered with kind of plastic wrap to keep the wind and cold away but it did not work out at all. The room faces the highway and it was horrible noisy as well during the day as well as in the night! It was very difficult to fall aslepp as a matter of fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "2453   I have used airbnb for almost 3 years, either by my own account or my sister's account, and I have to say this was my worst experience ever. I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience. \\r\\nIn addition, the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle, and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.\\r\\nAgain, I never want to post a negative comment, but this was just too much for me. I guess the only cons is that parking is easily available, and maybe a relatively low price. But still, I think for that price I can get a better place where I can at least sleep peacefully at night.\\r\\nLastly, Anthony was easy to contact with, he replied me instantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "3536   Desde el principio Lev fue un anfitrión muy atento, respondiendo rápidamente a cualquier consulta o reclamación. Hubo un malentendido por nuestra parte cuando elegimos este apartamento, al creer que la capacidad de 6 personas que figura en la información se debía a que aparte de las dos camas dobles de las habitaciones, el sofá que hay en el salón era sofá-cama, lo que era lo que buscábamos porque a pesar de ser solo 4 personas, nuestra hija y nuestro hijo son ya mayores y preferian dormir separados. Al ver cuando llegamos que no era así, le hicimos saber a Lev nuestro malestar, pero él nos dijo que cuando son más de 4 personas tiene una cama hinchable, que nos ofreció inmediatamente sin sobrecoste alguno.\\r\\nSon de agradecer detalles al recibimiento como fruta, leche o zumo y otros en la nevera (estos últimos a reponer, pero que  hacen más cómoda la llegada) y bombones.\\r\\nEn cuanto al apartamento, lo mejor es la ubicación, a pocos minutos del Common y la flexibilidad en el horario de entrada con el lock-box. Lo peor, la subida de 4 pisos con 4 maletas por la empinada y sucísima escalera, que da una impresión horrible. El apartamento en sí estaba limpio aunque no tanto como se espera de alguien que te pide que dejes tus zapatos fuera, encontrando algunas baldas con polvo acumulado. \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "4300   This was a horrible experience.  My family and I went to Boston for a medical procedure for my son.   We booked the apartment for 2 weeks and checked out after 5 days.  The neighborhood was bad and the apartment was filthy.   We spent 2-3 hours cleaning the kitchen in an effort to cook and feel comfortable.  There were spiders and spider webs that we saw on a regular basis.  A tree fell in the neigbors yard over their garage (out of their control).  When the company showed up to clear the tree I texted Eric....he told be to call his mother.  NOT MY JOB!!!   I contacted Eric to explain why we checked out and he said I should have said something the day we checked in.  As I mentioned previously we were in Boston for a medical procedure and my priority was on my son and not contacting him about the apartment.  His response was, \"This is not a fair response\".  I will never return nor do I have anything good to say about our experience with Eric or his apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "4620   Erin and J.D. were incredible hosts.  This was my first time using an Airbnb & I could not have envisioned a more pleasant experience.  If I am in need of a room again in the Boston area, I would definitely check their abvailiblitity first.  There was ample parking right outside, the house was easy to find, the room (and whole house) was fresh and clean. Their dogs were amazingly well behaved.\\r\\nI also enjoyed Erin and J.D's company - I had been in the car for 6 hours driving from NYC to Boston - traffic was horrible - I was greeted with a smile and a glass of wine.  I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone to stay at \"Must Love Dogs\"!!!!\\r\\nThanks Erin & J.D.!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "10010  The neighborhood is sketchy and their was nobody at the home to welcome me. The room was shockingly small and not very clean. The bed was in horrible condition and was topped with a musty comforter. There was a towel with a huge bleach stain on the bed. I opened the window to let some air in the room and after ten minutes decided to leave. I booked another room in a different area and was much happier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "12305  The apartment was very spacious and accommodated our group of five during Boston Marathon weekend. Street parking was safe and remained lit at night, the T was super close and glad to see that Zip Car was available for a future stay. Alisa and Kacey were friendly, answering my questions promptly and providing convenient check-in and out. My only negatives:\\r\\n- A cat lives there, and with horrible allergies, I required medication during our whole weekend. :(\\r\\n- The fridge and freezer were pretty full, so it was tough for us to fit our groceries in there. \\r\\n- The range, oven and microwave were pretty messy upon arrival. \\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "14908  The loft was really beautiful and enough space for the four of us! The entire aesthetic of the place was amazing along with the awesome turntable! David gave us clear instructions/notes before we got there so everything was smooth. We were prepared for five flight of stairs and yes, it was a struggle taking luggage up and down them, but it was manageable. One of problems we faced had to do with the bathroom. There wasn't any mat next to the shower or hand towel next to the sink. Hence we would mostly use the kitchen sink for all purposes because it was impractical to wash our hands in the bathroom sink, but dry our hands with the kitchen hand towel. Also, I'm not sure if the place wasn't clean properly or because the windows were open 24/7, but my clean feet wouldn't last 5 minutes walking around without shoes without them getting completely dirty again. So I would definitely bring a pair of house slippers. Lastly, we had a horrible experience on our last day with the temperatures being 90 degrees. Living in the south, we know heat, but it was even worse without an AC. It was unbearable and oddly enough, it was cooler outside the apartment versus inside it (heat definitely rises in this building). The entire apartment felt like a sauna so I would either wait until a AC is installed or avoid this place in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "19184  Perfect location for exploring Boston!Two disappointing things about our stay:  Wi-fi connection was horrible.  Bummed that we had to spend $84 for parking that was nowhere close to our accommodations. Why not purchase a resident parking permit that can be given to visitors so that they can park in the neighborhood during their stay and returned to you when they leave?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "25466  Our experience staying with 杨老师(Ms.Yang) and her family was very positive. Since we were unfamiliar with Boston's public transportation, she offered to pick us up from the nearest metro station. When we managed to even mess that one up (blame our horrible sense of direction), her son generously came all the way to where we were and drove us home. They also happily shared their kitchen to nurse my dad's culinary itch. On our first night, we watched TV with the family, which was like having a home away from home. There's a wide variety of choices for breakfast, and the rooms were very clean and well-managed. I would recommend them as hosts if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing place a bit outside of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "25742  Maura was incredibly welcoming! We got stuck in horrible traffic on our arrival day and Maura was very understanding and flexible when we arrived very late at night. The house is exactly as advertised, so much privacy and the room is very large and well equipped with amentaties. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful. We throughly enjoyed our stay, thank you so much Maura!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "27344  Although I do believe our host attempted to make us have a comfortable stay, there were some pretty terrible parts that really affected our stay.  First of all, the thermostat was set to go down to 54 degrees automatically every evening and in the 60s during the day.  The program set (once I found it) had it triggered to go down multiple times during the day and evening.  No matter what we turned it up to, it automatically turned it back down.  Needless to say, we both got the flu.  Being there for work where we had to go to the conference center was terrible.  Not only were we sick, but the walk brought us through the area that was burnt out factory buildings.  Not the safest for two girls to walk through.  The neighborhood is up and coming and had some fun spots.  Food was easy to find and the actual street we were on was ok.  What was also a horrible part of the experience was the neighbors.  On Saturday night there was a huge party up and down the block due to a parade the next day.  The lack of insulation had the two sick, cold girls left with no sleep.  For the next night, the neighbors upstairs had a fight so bad that we almost called the police.  Terrible.  So no sleep that night.  Then the final night had street work with jack hammers happening all night.  I have a video of jack hammers going at 3:00 am, so very unhappy.  Overall, this was not a great experience and with the thermostat control, downright miserable.  I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are going here for work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "28779  Lawrence was an excellent host and was available by phone or text at any time during our whole trip. The apartment was absolutely beautiful and immaculately clean. It's very nicely decorated and very bright and open feeling with all of the natural light coming in from all of the windows . It was quiet in the apartment with nice views overlooking the park next door.  There is plenty of room for a whole family with the three bedrooms and it's much larger than most of the other apartments that we looked at while planning our trip. It was also great that off street parking was included with the apartment at no additional charge as the parking situation in Boston is horrible. The Forrest Hills Station of the T was a short drive away and it was easy to access the whole rest of the city from there. The few times that we did drive in to the city it was only about a 1/2 hour at most to downtown. Overall it was a great place to stay for our family trip to Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "29568  This is a good value for the budget traveler. We didn't get to meet Emma in person, but she was a terrific communicator.  She was friendly, very quick to respond to our inquiry and questions, and gave clear information about how get into the apartment and make ourselves at home. We arrived in the morning after a redeye, and we very much appreciated Emma's flexibility in allowing us an early check in - thank you Emma! The place is a small 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom flat on the 2nd floor. It is clean, bright and pleasant in the common area (small living room+efficiency kitchen). The kitchen has dishes available for use. The bedroom that we stayed in, B, is very small; it was tight for 2 people, but would be more comfortable for one. It has a student-type desk wedged between the closet and the bed, so the desk serves as the bedside table. The bed (which we found *very* comfortable!) is wedged between the desk and the wall/window.  It was nice to look out the window and see the next door neighbor's garden. There's an air conditioner in the window which we didn't have to use; the overhead fan made the room temperature quite pleasant. There is no mirror in the bedroom, which is unfortunate, because you do share the bathroom with guests staying in the other 2 bedrooms, so you might have to wait a while to be able to use a mirror. 1 towel is provided for each guest, but there was no bath mat. There was cleaning equipment (vacuum, mop, bucket) sitting in the common area (living room/kitchen) for the 3 days we were there. Warning to people sensitive to smells: there was a *very* strong horrible smell in the foyer and stairway of the building itself.  Made it very unpleasant to arrive \"home\" and walk up the stairs to the apartment; it made our stay much less pleasant than we would have liked, and for that reason we won't stay here again. Once inside the actual flat we didn't smell it, so that was good. I'm sure many people would be fine staying here, given the good value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "31684  South Boston has a gem!  This place was very clean and exactly as described, beautiful and private.  We came and found exactly what the pictures show, a large second floor room with a private bath and (if there weren't 3 feet of snow on it) a nice outdoor deck.  The space was bright and spacious, and the bed was comfortable. We were busy with a trade show and weren't ever able to cross paths with Peter, but our directions were accurate and access was easy with the lock box for a hidden key.  Even with the horrible winter Boston has been through, we were able to park within one block both nights.  \\r\\nThanks and good luck Peter!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "33122  We stayed at Gerard's and Marie's apartment during the weekend of the 2013 Boston Marathon.

       "33456  I don't even know where to begin. The host was fantastic! I went to celebrate my birthday with some friends and she even had a balloon, a mug full of candy and a card for me which she really didn't have to but it was super sweet. She was very adamant about us feeling at home and making sure that all accommodations were made. She even provided us with some refreshments, extra blankets, towels and etc. She was readily available to contact at any time. One time we had difficulty getting in around 3am and she answered right away and stayed on the line until we got in (I felt horrible about it but she was so kind). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe place itself was great. Very clean, comfy, spacious for its one floor and very very cozy. Her furniture is so comfortable and her beds, it was great for us to sleep in on and relax. The community around it is nice. Angela's cafe right next to the apartment is a nice place to go get some muffins, cafe con leche and breakfast. The bakery a couple blocks down has some awesome bread and pastries. It's safe and super convenient to get to the metro from. We all came in at different times and some came a day later and her place being right next to the metro near the airport really made coming and leaving a lot more convenient. My 5 other friends that came with me and myself couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. They all enjoyed themselves. It was my first time in boston & using AirBnB and I have absolutely no complaints with Elisangela I definitely would use her place again when I come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "33957  Rachel was a fantastic host. Very welcoming and helpful. once our booking was done, Rachel provided us all with the details about the apartment, parking and the surrounding areas. She was extremely kind  and had no issues even though we checked in pretty late (Post mid-night. The traffic from NY to Boston was horrible).\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew I was travelling with a friend. To welcome us, she left us a beautiful card and a bottle of wine with 2 wine glasses (Rachel, you are awesome). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself was beautiful, very tastefully done up and a highlight in itself during our stay in Boston. The location was amazing with everything at walking distance (Quincy Market, Hanover street, City tours, water front).\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel was extremely considerate in what was provided to us. We never had to ask or look for anything. She had told us everything in advance regarding where to find what. \\r\\n\\r\\nI bugged her with many questions before arrival but she very patiently answered all my questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur trip to Boston was a memorable one, and Rachel's kindness and her apartment were a huge factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely recommend staying at Rachel's apartment if you are travelling to Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "34666  In short: poor communication, unhygienic and dirty, electricity issues and unexpected surge pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I had always had great experiences with Airbnb, the experience with Josefa was horrible. My complaints start with unexpected surge pricing and continue with every aspect of the experience\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Josefa advertises her room for $69, when I filled the application the price changed to $87. I asked her about this change and she told me that the price depends on the day. But when I checked the price on Airbnb the next day, the website still listed it at $69. Very suspicious surge pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor communication continues to my arrival: I wrote Josefa my arriving time at Boston and she said it would be no problem. However, when I landed in Boston at 3pm and was in the taxi she sent me a message that neither she nor her daughter were home. The daughter’s boyfriend could let me in after 5pm. I had to change my plans and wait. This was already a red flag. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlex, the very kind boyfriend, let me in. But then the room had some cleanliness issues: the bed looked like somebody had slept in it already and the sheets had stains. Since now it was 9 pm, I had no choice but to sleep in there. The room was cold and drafty, so the next day I asked for blankets – but the ones I received also looked like have not been laundered. This raises serious hygiene concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it get’s worse: next day there was an electricity outage in my room, and the only way to get any light was to get an extension cord from one of the rooms to mine, so that I could have one lamp. Connecting the cords, I looked on the floor and wished I hadn’t. A lot of dust. Wonder what the $50 cleaning fee is for?! The long cord was also a tripping hazard.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Josepha nor her daughter – who arrived in the middle of the night but hardly spoke with me - ever bothered to ask how my experience was, or to apologize for the fact that I was without electricity. There was clearly no interest in being a good host.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, the experience was terrible: bad communication, a drafty and dirty room, and no electricity. The host was dishonest about the price, and disinterested in my experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only positive sign was the dog and the daughter’s boyfriend, Alex, who was polite and nice and tried his best.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "36260  Sean responded quickly to all inquiries. The instructions to enter the building were clear, and we had no problems finding and opening the lockbox for the keys.\\r\\nThe apartment wasn't (URL HIDDEN) was as described, though the bathroom and kitchen were a bit dingy. We were only there for one night, so we avoided using the kitchen. The bathroom could use some upgrades, but, since this is a rented apartment, the landlord would have to take care of that. We were unable to open the bed in the couch, which sucked...but for one night, whatever.\\r\\nThe apartment is in a nice location, though there is no parking lot, so we had to pay to park at the gas station next door. The view of Fenway from the living room and kitchen is awesome.\\r\\nAll in all, not a horrible night...but I wouldn't stay there again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "36264  Seans apartment is in a really nice location in Boston, we were able to get around very easily either by foot or by train. The apartment itself is a pretty reasonable size compared to other 1 bedroom/studios we have stayed in. Having said that Boston was recently announced as one of the most expensive cities for airbnb apartments and its clear that you get what you pay for. While the location was good the apartment is very old and is in desperate need of some love. While it was good for our first time in Boston I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend or stay there again, instead pay a little bit more and stay somewhere cleaner. \\n\\nWhile Sean's communication was good, it was clear through this communication that the rest of his apartment block is not allowed to know about the fact he uses airbnb. This made us feel incredibly uncomfortable and as if we were doing something wrong by staying there. We were instructed not to speak to anyone/talk about airbnb in the hall/wait outside the building with luggage etc..this awful feeling is one of the major reasons we would not stay again aside from the cleanliness. We are on holiday and it is horrible to constantly feel on edge and as if you were doing something illegal when really airbnb is a great system that when it is allowed can be unforgettable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "36686  This place is very well located and is a small flat so you have a kitchen with microwave and stove, very convenient when you stay for a few days. \\r\\nUnfortunately, there were inconvenients that didn't make this stay very enjoyable. The bed was nice but the folding couch was horrible to sleep on! I couldn't believe how uncomfortable that was! You could feel all the metal underneath, it was probably better to sleep on the ground. Also, the place wasn't very clean: the fridge was empty but hadn't been cleaned and the bathroom was very dusty and there were still hairs in the sink. We never saw our host and there was barely any sightseeing information in the place. I admit I was hoping for something better when I made the reservation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "38228  To be very honest, I hoped not to leave a negative review but the actions of the hosts have led me no choice but to do so. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all- I originally booked a stay from 8/4-9/4 but the host did not want to change the stay so I had no choice but to settle for a 8/3-9/3 stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts were pretty nice so I didn't want to leave such a review. But the stay was very uncomfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is extremely dirty and the conditions of the room were horrible. Yes there was a bed and a table and a chair, but it looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the last decade. \\r\\n\\r\\nDust was EVERYWHERE to the point where you smelt dust when you were sleeping. The carpet was dirty and the floor was unclean. I'm not sure why they bother asking for a $50 cleaning fee when it doesn't look like anyone cleans it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAside from this, the bathroom is indescribable. Its a TINY bathroom that around 6 people share- more if you include guests who sometimes come really late at night and can get REALLY disruptive and LOUD\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I know it mentions \"free breakfast\" but don't expect anything. There will be no free breakfast or anything. No one is going to cook for you or provide the materials to cook such \"complimentary breakfast\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that isn't even the issue. I'm already spending $1,500 to stay here I'm not going to complain about a $2 breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most despicable aspect was when I asked them to change the move out date. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're going to follow a \"flexible\" policy then follow it.\\r\\nIf you're going to promise one thing, follow it. Don't say one thing and do another. \\r\\n\\r\\nI asked the hosts before I requested an alteration if \"I could request an earlier move out date\" \\r\\n\\r\\nIf they said \"no\", I would've accepted even if it meant losing around $250\\r\\n\\r\\nHOWEVER, they said sure we will adjust the stay and refund you the nights you didn't stay. So I went ahead and adjusted- and no reply. I asked them again in person AGAIN, and they said \"We have to talk it over and adjust it, no problem\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I waited, until its already 9/3. Its been OVER 10+ days and they have been COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I contacted airbnb and basically FORCED the hosts to reply in which they rejected my request. \\r\\n\\r\\n?? excuse me, if you were going to reject it why tell me you would refund my nights?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow its almost 1 MONTH after and they are still not responsive. I have called airbnb and filed an official complaint against them- including opening a case for them to return my money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether my money is returned or not, I just want to warn everyone that:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.) not a healthy, or clean environment to stay in\\r\\n2.) don't stay here if you don't want to deal with irresponsible, frustrating people\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \n",
       "39134  We had a great stay at Washington Street over the Boston marathon long weekend.  The apartment is spacious and well appointed. It was ideally located. 2km walk to Boston Common or only a few minutes on the Silverline Bus which stopped right outside the apartment. It was also really easy to take the bus to the train station when we left for New York. The apartment was toasty warm on a horrible wet and cold weekend in Boston. Plenty of good restaurants nearby although we couldn't find a decent supermarket. The only small drawbacks were brown water in the bath/shower (but that didn't phase us) and a noisy heating system. Our host communicated with us promptly and accessing the apartment was easy. We would stay again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "42255  We enjoyed our 5-night stay from July 2 to July 7.  Apartment is small but very convenient and within walking distance of most of what we wanted to see and do.  Maggie was very generous in letting us check in early and drop our luggage even though there was someone checking out the day we checked in.  Rooftop view of the city is fantastic!  Our only issue was that we only had two bath towels and two hand towels for the duration of our stay, which was alternately hot and humid then terribly rainy with the tropical storm.  We would have washed them with the available washer and dryer on the floor, and also would have taken care of some of our wet clothes from the horrible rain, but we had used the dryer once to fluff up some of our clothes that were wrinkly from packing and there wasn't enough credit to do a full wash and dry.  I tried contacting Maggie twice to ask if there was a way (at our expense) to recharge the card but she did not contact us back.  It was a holiday weekend so maybe she was unavailable.  Other than that, it was a great time, and I would recommend this listing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "44001  I rented Jason's place for an international work colleagues which I indicated to him upon requesting the reservation. I was going to be the contact person since I booked it through my account. All seemed fine. The first (although small) hickup was the confirmation on how to obtain the keys was only sent the morning of my colleague's arrival (I had asked the day before after not hearing about it from Jason at all). My colleague was already on the plane but luckily he was able to check emails upon arrival to find out how to access the place. Phew. His assessment of the apt afterwards was: \"The place was mostly clean (except for blankets on the couch that smelled like pets), but it wasn’t a “homely” place that I would immediately recommend: the bedroom was a single air mattress on the ground of an otherwise empty room. It had wifi, an mini ironing board, and heating, so I guess that’s everything I needed. Knowing that the TV didn’t work ahead of time might have been helpful to other visitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFine. He had all the basics and we were not further going to worry about the non-homyness or anything else. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince no instructions on what to do with the keys were sent until 6:45am of the day of departure it was too late to inform my colleague who had left early. A few days later I get a message from Jason, \"He's going to get a horrible review\", without further explanation. Since the booking was through my account I enquired with him and learned that Jason thought my colleague had not locked the door! \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon immediate consultation with my colleague I learned that he \\r\\nhad left the keys on the kitchen table. He had to make a good faith decision to leave the keys in the house with the door snapped shut preventing access without a key. It was the better option than to hand off the keys uninstructed (at that time of departure) in any other way (apparently preferred). (More detail: My colleague had locked one of the two locks from the inside to make sure your place would be locked. Of course he was not able lock the second deadbolt lock because he left the keys inside.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim that the door was not locked at all and not even enquiring with me but instead immediately threatening a \"horrible review\" made me very uncomfortable. The whole thing could have easily been avoided in the first place if Jason would have sent timely instructions. I had to ask for every detail before getting an answer. Compared to previous airbnb bookings this was not very forthcoming but perhaps I have been spoiled by other hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, to be fair, Jason responded with \"Ok no worries\" after I explained the door situation. However, I feel compelled now to write about this experience after I was notified that Jason had completed his review and not knowing what he would say in there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \n",
       "44076  Sean was very nice and gave clear instructions on how to get in the apartment. I liked that my husband and I didn't have to be there at any particular time. We were able to get the keys when we arrived. \\r\\nWhile it was nice to be so close to the nightlife of Boston, it was a little too close. We arrived on a Saturday night and were within walking distance of an awesome bowling alley/bar. However, this bar is literally right outside of the window of the apartment and people were out being very loud until about 3am, so we didn't get much sleep.\\r\\n Because of this, I would recommend the apartment to people interested in experiencing Boston nightlife. It's not for people looking for a good night's sleep. \\r\\nThe building is pretty run down. The elevator is a bit scary- like one that you've only seen in black and white movies. It reminded me a bit of the Tower of Terror at Disney World. \\r\\nThe walls of the building are paper thin so you can easily hear people in the other apartments. \\r\\nThe apartment is on the grungy side. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. There is no top sheet on the futon bed. There is no television but there is internet. \\r\\nWe weren't told what time to leave the next day so we were planning on noon. A little before noon, the door unlocked and 3 people walked in. They were the next renters and were told it was okay to come. It would have been nice if Sean let me know as the bed was not made and we had a few dishes to do. I felt bad having the next people come in without having the place cleaned a bit first. \\r\\nOverall, it was not a horrible experience. It was fun being in that area despite not getting much sleep. You get what you pay for I guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "44712  The apartment was located right in the middle of Downton Crossing which made travel to any other parts of Boston easy.  The apartment is furnished in a minimalistic style, which was not a problem for us, but if you want \"luxury\" this is not the apartment for you.  It was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the in house laundry was great! You can hear the city sounds at night in the street side bedrooms, but nothing that was horrible.  The rest of the apartment was VERY quiet. We loved everything about the place, except the lack of blinds in the common living area.  The lack of privacy did feel like we were living in a fishbowl for the rest of the residents to see.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJon was always available and quick to respond by message.

Seriously, it doesn't get better.\\n- Comfortable bed and lounge\\n- We didn't meet Ned, but we didn't need to. He was easily reached by phone or text, and check-in was made easy because the building has a doorperson.\\n- The view from the roof is amazing - you should go out there straight away on arrival.\\n\\nThe Not-So-Good:\\n- The convenience store next door is horrible - not Ned's problem, just saying ...\\n- It takes 4 minutes for the water to get hot in the shower (but, once it gets hot it is great)\\n- Kitchen window needs a curtain - think about your mode of dress before going to the kitchen   >:-D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "50721  Before I start this review, I have some notes for the owner/landlord: 1. Make (and follow) a cleaning checklist for yourself that is used after each tenant departs. This checklist should include: *Change out all linens and replace with clean, fresh, linens (including mattress pads). All pillows and down/faux down comforters should have fresh/clean covers. Replace towels with clean/fresh towels that are in good condition and free of rips/tears/frays. *Wash all dirty dishes, dry them, and place them away neatly in the cabinets. Wipe down all surfaces with an antibacterial cleaner. *Check for trash and remove all trash from apartment (includes looking inside the bathroom medicine cabinet and refrigerator). *Dust all surfaces (including window sills, table, cubby/shelves. *Scrub shower and toilet (Mr. Clean bathroom magic eraser works well for the tub). Also wipe down walls and sink with a bathroom cleaner (and ceiling if necessary). *vacuum all floors and follow with mop or Swiffer mop. *shampoo area rug every month. Vacuum after every tenant. *check bed frame for needed repairs. Repair (professionally) as needed, before renting to a new tenant. Check mattresses for stains/wear & tear and replace as needed. *Check all areas of apartment for needed repairs and repair as necessary. Upon arrival, it was easy to find and open the lockbox. Apparently the address is no longer on Irving St. The key wouldn't work, so I had to call Sean. He said the new address should have been emailed to me, but it wasn't. The new apartment is just around the corner though and easy to find. The entry from the street was easy to find and enter. After going up to flights of stairs (no elevator, beware if you have a lot of luggage), we made it to our door (#6). Entry was no problem, but locking it from the inside and outside was hard and took a lot of effort to get the door just right so it would lock. Sean thought we were arriving later than we did, so he said he was on the way to change/do the laundry. When we walked in, the previous tenants bedding was on the bed, and trash was under the sink area. We were hungry anyway so we dropped our luggage and went to find dinner. When we arrived at the apartment a couple hours later, fresh bedding was on the queen bed, but the twin bed underneath was only covered by a mattress pad. Upon sitting on the queen bed, it made a horrible creaking noise every time we moved even an inch. Upon further inspection, we found a paint can supporting the bed frame as well as broken slats underneath the mattress. It also sounds like there is a hard plastic cover on the mattress. I looked for a sheet to cover the twin mattress, but the only thing I found was an uncovered faux down blanket. I text Sean to ask about the sheet, and after 15 minutes of no response, I called him. He...             \n",
       "53368  We had a good short stay in Sean's apartment. It's very well located & great area. I think the apartment is as described, clean & had plenty of room for the two of us (but we are pretty low maintenance). . .Sean was helpful with letting us leave our bags at his place after a horrible overnight bus. However, was a bit slow giving us a specific time early on for check in after I asked if it would be possible to go earlier in the morning - he just kinda put of answering - woulda been nice to just get a specific time & arrangement earlier to arrange our short stay around that. Also, I hate to say it but there is still a few bed bugs. Nothing too serious - i was fine (& we kept our stuff well away in case) but my boyfriend got attacked all over the top of one of his legs :( & completely understand they are tres difficult to get rid of & Sean seems on top of the problem. But overall well priced, comfortable & well located apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "53554  Sean was prompt in answering phone calls, though he seemed not to be reading SMS and emails. So contact him by phone calls. \\r\\n\\r\\nPros: The place was overall clean. The location is very convenient and close to the Green Line and many shops. The fridge and the microwave oven worked properly. \\r\\n\\r\\nCons: The studio is small and the facilities inside seemed quite old. The faucet in the bathroom could not be closed tightly. The sound of dribbling of water was annoying and it was quite a waste of water. (I have known this from the host manual beforehand but could not understand why Sean did not fix it.) The location is too close to Huntington Ave and the noise at night was horrible. The air conditioner did not seem to work properly and was quite noisy. Interestingly we managed to use the noise of the air conditioner as \"white noise\" to cover the noise from outside so that we had a better sleep at night... \\r\\n\\r\\nYou got what you paid for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "56154  The apartment is in a nice neighborhood, super convenient for sure, with a train station right in front of the building, 10-minute walk from NEC, next door to MFA and Northeastern Univ. The room itself is fine, very exotically decorated which I found interesting. YET, the bathroom was horrible. It was extremely clear that no one had ever cleaned it in a long time. The toilet was so filthy, the basin had plenty of old shaved-off beard on it plus a used  cotton bud...... I wouldn't even mention the floor... Anyways, I'm glad I'm only staying for one night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "58999  There were positives and negatives to this place.  The positives: 1. Great location.  Not far from the airport.  A block away from the heart of Little Italy. A 20 minute walk to Boston Common and 15 minutes to TD Garden.  2. The host was very responsive to any complaints or questions.  3. The bed, couch and recliner were very comfortable and the wireless internet was FAST.  The Negatives: In my requirements I asked for a washer and dryer.  They were there, but neither worked.  Wasted 4 hours trying to do a wash.  Coin laundry was in basement but no change machine.  Had to wander the neighborhood looking for change.  I also stipulated Cable TV.  It had it, but the worst cable ever.  10 channels; the 3 networks, 2 pbs, 2 shopping channels and 3 indy stations that only played horrible reruns from the 60's 70's and 80's. Not a single sports or news channel.  The place was not dirty but certainly was not clean.  Kitchen sink and counter were a bit grungy.  My daughter slept on couch in living room.  Very comfortable, but at 7 in the morning the TV and kitchen light would all of a sudden come on.  Also there's no place to unpack.  Absolutley no closet or drawer space, so be prepared to live out of your bag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "60893  We know this neighborhood well and understand what old buildings are all about...we used to live similar buildings one block over and also in the North End. I also grew up in a house built in 1695. So that you don’t get the impression that we are habitual complainers, in all our travels we have **never** issued a complaint for any place we have ever lodged…for anything. And we don't expect to be coddled either...we do primitive camping 15-20 days a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very sorry to inform that this unit completely failed to meet our lowest expectations. A $225/night price for small unit such as this implies a level of quality and cleanliness that was simply not met. The fact that this rental has a 4.5 star rating brings into question the accuracy and value of the AirBnB rating system. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe building itself is run down. From the outside, it is the worst looking building on the block. This, it turns out, is also indicative of the inside. The interior common areas are also run down. For example: there is plaster decay depositing debris from ceiling in the hallway leading to your door. Once inside, the apartment is hardly well lit, as the title of the ad says and the over-exposed photos in the posting imply. The carpeting by the bed was filthy. To claim the unit works for up to three people is questionable, in our opinion. The bed is suitable for one adult only...which is why my husband slept on the floor with an inflatable backpacking sleeping pad. The couch is not suitable for sleeping on....even our 13 year old daughter who is not picky about sleeping arrangements had a horrible night's sleep. On the floor near where you have mirrors propped against the wall are exposed staples in the floor...I assume left over from carpet that was once there. With a black tile, black refrigerator, black counter top, black stove, dark flooring, and a very dim overhead light, the kitchen was difficult to see and work in. The refrigerator was dented and scratched up. There is a large amount of dust and build up next to and under the refrigerator and stove. The toaster oven sits right on the range...I would never think of turning on one of the heating elements for fear of starting a fire (is this how the knob on the toaster oven got burned?). Many of the floor tiles in the kitchen are peeling up. The A/C unit looks like it has been duct taped into the window. There is a lot of clutter in the unit…to the point we were afraid of leave something behind. With all this, we had to wonder how clean the towels, sheets and dishes were. The bathroom was the one aspect of the unit that we found reasonably acceptable.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "61273  Its impossible to describe our horrible experience. To be short, Marina accepted our booking, we were charged for that and she didn't show up to provide access to her apartment in Boston. All my messages, emails, calls were without answer when we arrived. I think its not necessary to say about  discomfort of being in a different city without a point of contact! The only one thing we could do (staying with our luggage on the street) its just to find the hotel. At that time it was a big conference in Boston and we had to pay much more then we were planning just to have a place to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "63570  Just deeply DISAPPOINTED!!! We had booked the appartment for 5 person (which is more expensive than just booking for 2). Curtis knew that we arrive with 5 adults. The first thing we reconized was the smell in the whole building. It was like a mixture of cat litter and old stuff, which was just spicy in your nose. When we came into the appartment the smell was there too, not that intensive but annoying. So we checked the rooms and had to search for the fifth possibilty to sleep at. An adult person would never fit into the couch, which you can see on the picture but Curtis wrote me that someone can sleep there aswell. \\r\\nAlso there was just 1 towel in the bathroom for 5 person. And we had to sleep with two people (with one sheet and not a blanket) on one of the singlebeds, which was horrible, because they aren´t comfortable even with just one person on it. \\r\\nFor breakfast we had first to clean the plates and cups, because we did not to eat the old crumbs of strangers. \\r\\nSo I have asked Curtis for what we have paid a daily rate for FIVE person when nothing is prepared for FIVE person. And why we have paid an amount for cleaning, when the apartment is not clean... So I gave him the chance to make me happy with reducing the amount after our stay and not getting this feedback. Just telling me that he is sorry about that and wishing me a good day is very disappointing! \\r\\nAnother thing is: Do not expect that the bathroom looks like on the picture. The joint between the tiles are brown and ugly and the smell in the bathroom is stronger than in the other rooms.\\r\\nA good advice from my side: Invest your money in a hotel and not into this apartment! If I pay for 5 people I expect that there are 5 possibilities which I can use! \\r\\nConclusion: Boston is a very nice city, but book a room in a hotel and not this apartment!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "64460  Both the owner and the apt manager were VERY responsive. Quick, thorough replies and very proactive. They were welcome to deal with as a business traveler.\\r\\n\\r\\nI used this apt as an alternative to the crazy hotel room prices downtown...and the horrible bed bug problem Boston hotels are NOT dealing with. The getting of the keys and instructions on using the apt are very well thought out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North End, and Hanover St is the heart of it!  It's busy day and night. Do not take this apt if you are seeking peace and tranquility. It's acurately described as a \"lively\" area. You have immediate access to great restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apt is cooled by two window units. Thankfully, both were going when I arrived. They did a good job of cooling the rooms. The second floor, which houses the bed and bathroom is as described. If you want soft sheets, I recommend you bring your own. I'm fanatical about having all-cotton bedding which this apt does not have. The towels and bathroom supplies are all clean and as expected. Nothing fancy, but perfectly functional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kitchen is small, but complete. I barely used it except for glassware.  I noticed a tumbler had a small crack in it and then stupidly used it. When washing the glasses the next morning, it shattered. I'm not sure its something the cleaning crew would normally catch, but there it was.  I cleaned up the glass and my cut and left a larger than normal tip for the cleaners and note that there was broken glass in the garbage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this was a positive experience which I would reuse.
